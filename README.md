A personal project for learning the Swift language, BlueBird will be a command-line application that I will be building to run on multiple operating systems. It will be a fun and challenging journey and I will be excited to see where this project takes me in terms of my understanding of the language.

As for the application itself, it will still be a work in progress and I will not be entirely sure what it will do yet. But I will be looking forward to experimenting with different features and functionality as I learn more about Swift.
